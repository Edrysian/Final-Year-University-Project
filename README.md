# Final-Year-Project

This repository is for me to showcase my final year project at the University of Portsmouth.

Overall, this project is something I am very proud of. I put many hours into the research, analysis of the data and writing of the code for this project.

## The premise

The premise of the project was that I wanted to show how technology could support neurodivergent people in the workplace. Whether they are accepted or not, anyone who is neurodivergent will always have to tackle things that are unseen by a neurotypical person. This can cause extra stress, anxiety and depression.

## Why a research project?

The way I felt technology could support neurodivergent people was by providing them with a way to help manage their tasks at work. Therefore, the idea of creating a webapp for this came about. However, after speaking with my amazing supervisor for this project, Mark Venn, I realised I wasn't as interested in creating a webapp as I was in explaining *why* it was needed. So, this became a research project, supported by the creation of a database to show how it could be applied in the real world, all it would need is a front end and it would be able to be used.

## How did I come up with this idea?

I came up with this idea after seeing how much my little brother was struggling with his workload at his Sixth Form, and how he felt that he would never be able to get a job as he just wouldn't know what to do once he finished what was asked of him. I realised I had similar worries, however, I was able to understand that I needed to go and find someone and ask what was next once I had completed a task.
I knew my brother would struggle to comprehend this (and he still does, though he tries his best).
So that's what ignited the spark for the idea to create something that can support neurodivergent people in the workplace.

The idea of the database is to store tasks and have it interact with a front end UI to show only a single task to the person. They can then set the task as complete, in which it shows the next task.

I mention in my research about the user also having the choice to see the next few tasks as some people may work better that way, as they can see the next thing they have to do, allowing them to mentally prepare for the next task once the current one is complete.

## What next?

I have taken a hiatus from hard coding things since finishing university and finding a job. As of August 2024, I am trying to slowing bring coding back into my daily life and I plan on creating a front end for my database, so that I can show it working to it's full potential. For now, I plan to only make this a webapp, as I want to ease myself back into things.

## Why now make the repository public?

I want to have projects visible on my GitHub so potential future employers are able to look at my skill and decide to hire me based on that. I realised that I was doing myself a disservice to not show these things off.
